# Falcor

Falcor is intended to solve several problems, namely, to be able to quickly define fixture data and use it for things like example JSON web services, mocking out tests, and seeding test data into document stores. The DSL should be very familiar to users of tools like FactoryGirl, but it doesn't require the class to exist before you define the factory.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'falcor'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install falcor
